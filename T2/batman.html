    When the first "HIDE" button is clicked, the texts of the first film will hide. Only title and synopsis, but not button, borders and background.
    When you click on the same button again, the film info will be shown again
    Complete the rest of the buttons on the page so that their behavior is identical to that of the first link.
    When a section is hidden, you must change the associated text of the button from "HIDE" to "SHOW"
    If the mouse moves over a movie, the div background will change to "lightblue". It will go back to "lightgray" when the mouse is out again.
